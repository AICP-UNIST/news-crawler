1. Search for your issue in the issue list or make issue.

   Pick an issue and comment that you'd like to work on the feature or bug-fix.
   If you need more context on a particular issue, please ask and we shall provide.

2. You want to propose a new feature and implement it.

   Post about your intended feature in an issue, then implement it.
   We suggest that the branch name that you implement is better to be {type}/{issue number}/{issue name}. ex) feature/118/githubAction, bugfix/120/typo

3. Open pull request

   You implement and test your feature or bug-fix, please submit a Pull Request with some test case.
   Once a pull request is accepted and CI is passing, there is nothing else you need to do. we will check and merge the PR for you.
